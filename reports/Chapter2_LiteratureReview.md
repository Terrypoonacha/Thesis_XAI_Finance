# Chapter 2: Literature Review

## 2.1 Financial Fraud Detection
The detection of fraudulent transactions, such as credit card fraud, has evolved from rule-based systems to complex Machine Learning (ML) models.
- **Traditional Methods**: Expert systems relying on if-then rules (e.g., "Transaction > €5000 at 3 AM -> Flag").
- **Supervised Learning**: Models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost (our chosen baseline) learn patterns from historical labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest) for novel fraud patterns.

While modern ML models like Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) offer superior predictive performance (AUPRC > 0.85), they often operate as "Black Boxes".

## 2.2 Explainable AI (XAI) in Finance
To trust these models, practitioners employ XAI techniques.
- **Global Interpretability**: Understanding the model as a whole (e.g., Feature Importance plots).
- **Local Interpretability**: Understanding individual predictions. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** is the gold standard, derived from cooperative game theory, providing unified measures of feature contribution. However, SHAP outputs are technical (e.g., "V14 = -2.3") and lack business context.

## 2.3 The Regulatory Landscape
Financial institutions operate under strict governance frameworks that mandate model transparency. This thesis focuses on two critical frameworks: The EU AI Act and BaFin's MaRisk.

### 2.3.1 The EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)
The efficient functioning of the internal market requires a uniform legal framework for AI products. The **Regulation (EU) 2024/1689** (EU AI Act) categorizes AI systems by risk. Systems used for **credit scoring** and **risk assessment** in relation to natural persons are classified as **High-Risk AI Systems** (Annex III).

**Article 13: Transparency and Provision of Information to Users**
Article 13 is the cornerstone of explainability in the Act. It mandates that high-risk AI systems must be designed and developed in such a way to ensure that their operation is sufficiently transparent to enable deployers to interpret the system's output and use it appropriately.
*   **Key Requirement**: The instructions for use must include concise, complete, correct, and clear information that is relevant, accessible, and comprehensible to users.
*   **Impact on Black Boxes**: Purely opaque models (like deep neural networks or unconstrained XGBoost ensembles) may fail this requirement if they cannot provide "concise and clear" rationale for their decisions.

### 2.3.2 BaFin MaRisk (Minimum Requirements for Risk Management)
In Germany, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) enforces the **MaRisk** circular (10/2021).

**AT 4.3.1: Changes in risk management systems**
This section governs the modification and expansion of risk management systems, including IT systems and models.
*   **Requirement**: Before integrating new models (like ML-based fraud detection), institutions must analyze the impact on personnel and technical/organizational processes.
*   **Model Understanding**: Implicit in AT 4.3.1 is the requirement that the institution must *understand* the new system to assess its impact. A "Black Box" that cannot be audited or understood poses an operational risk that must be mitigated.
*   **Connection to AT 4.3.2**: While AT 4.3.1 focuses on the change process, AT 4.3.2 mandates the suitability of the procedures themselves. Together, they create a regulatory environment where unexplained model outputs are unacceptable for critical risk decisions.

## 2.4 The Knowledge Gap: Automated Compliance
Current literature addresses:
1.  Improving fraud detection accuracy (the ML domain).
2.  Generating technical explanations (the XAI domain).
3.  Defining regulatory requirements (the Legal domain).

There is a significant gap in **Bridging the Divide**: Translating technical XAI outputs ("V14 is high") into legal compliance documentation ("This transaction is flagged due to V14, requiring review under MaRisk AT 4.3.2"). This thesis proposes an **Agentic Workflow** using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate this "last mile" of explainability.
